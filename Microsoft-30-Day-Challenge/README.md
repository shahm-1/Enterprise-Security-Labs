## Purpose of This Challenge

- Learn cybersecurity by doing, not memorizing  
- Work directly with real systems, telemetry, and investigations  
- Develop practical SOC-level skills through hands-on projects  
- Demonstrate what a modern cloud SOC analyst actually does  
- Share the journey and lessons learned with others interested in cybersecurity

## Project Overview

This repository documents a 30-day, hands-on Microsoft cloud SOC challenge focused on building and operating a real lab environment.

The project centers on designing a Microsoft-based SOC lab, onboarding security tooling, validating telemetry, and using that environment to conduct threat hunts, analyze phishing activity, investigate alerts, and produce incident-style reports.

The goal is to simulate how a real SOC environment operates and to capture the technical work, investigation process, and documentation that comes with it.


## Current Lab Environment

This section represents the current state of the SOC lab used as the foundation for all investigations and mini-projects.
