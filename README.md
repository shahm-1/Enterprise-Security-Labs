# 🏗️ Enterprise Security Labs

Production-style lab environments for hands-on security operations, detection engineering, and threat simulation.

**4 Complete Lab Environments** | **Microsoft Cloud SOC** | **Splunk SIEM** | **Active Directory** | **Azure Identity**

---

## 🎯 What's Inside

Each lab represents a complete, maintainable environment where I practice detection engineering, test security controls, and simulate real-world attack scenarios. These aren't one-time setups — they're the foundation for my [threat hunting investigations](https://github.com/shahm-1/Threat-Hunting-Portfolio) and query development.

## ☁️ Microsoft 30-Day Cloud SOC Challenge

**[→ View Full Project](./Microsoft-30-Day-Challenge/)**

**What I Built:**
- Complete Microsoft cloud SOC from scratch
- Microsoft Sentinel SIEM with custom analytics rules
- Defender XDR for endpoint detection and response
- Azure Entra ID for identity management
- Microsoft Intune for device management

**What I Did:**
- Conducted phishing investigations with email analysis
- Built KQL queries for threat hunting
- Performed incident response following MITRE ATT&CK
- Created detection rules and analytics
- Documented real SOC cases with timelines

**Skills Demonstrated:** KQL query writing • Incident response • Threat hunting • Log correlation • MITRE ATT&CK mapping • Cloud security

**Stack:** Microsoft Sentinel • Defender XDR • Entra ID • Intune • Azure Monitor • KQL

## 📊 Splunk 101 - SOC Investigation

**[→ View Full Project](./Splunk101-Capstone/)**

**What I Built:**
- Splunk Enterprise SIEM environment
- Windows endpoint with Sysmon logging
- Log forwarding and data ingestion pipeline
- Multi-stage cyberattack investigation

**What I Did:**
- Investigated complete attack chain: brute force → persistence → privilege escalation
- Built SPL queries for security event correlation
- Analyzed Sysmon telemetry
- Created investigation timeline with evidence
- Mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework

**Skills Demonstrated:** Splunk SPL • Sysmon analysis • Log aggregation • Windows event monitoring • Attack chain reconstruction • Incident reporting

**Stack:** Splunk Enterprise • Universal Forwarder • Sysmon • Windows Server • SPL

## 🏢 Active Directory Enterprise Lab

**[→ View Full Project](./Active-Directory-Enterprise-Lab/)**

**What I Built:**
- Domain Active Directory forest
- Domain controllers with DNS integration
- Organizational Units


**What I Use It For:**
- Automation User Creation
- Connecting Client's to the Domain
- Configuring Networking Services for Client Connectivity


**Skills Demonstrated:** Active Directory administration • Domain architecture 

**Stack:** Windows Server 2019/2022 • Active Directory • DNS • Group Policy • PowerShell

## ☁️ Azure & Entra ID Identity Lab

**[→ View Full Project](./Azure-Entra-ID-Identity-Lab/)**

**What I Built:**
- Entra ID Cloud Environment
- Conditional access policies
- Multi-factor authentication enforcement
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

**What I Use It For:**
- Practicing zero trust implementations
- Building cloud security detection rules

**Skills Demonstrated:** Cloud identity management • Conditional access • MFA enforcement • Identity protection • Cloud security monitoring

**Stack:** Azure Entra ID • Microsoft 365 • Conditional Access
