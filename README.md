# 🏗️ Enterprise Security Labs

Production-style lab environments for hands-on security operations, detection engineering, and threat simulation.

**5 Complete Lab Environments** | **Microsoft Cloud SOC** | **Splunk SIEM** | **Active Directory** | **Azure Identity** | **SOC Workflows**

---

## 🎯 What's Inside

Each lab represents a complete, maintainable environment where I practice detection engineering, test security controls, and simulate real-world attack scenarios. These aren't one-time setups — they're the foundation for my [threat hunting investigations](https://github.com/shahm-1/Threat-Hunting-Portfolio) and query development.

## ☁️ Microsoft 30-Day Cloud SOC Challenge

**[→ View Full Project](./Microsoft-30-Day-Challenge/)**

**What I Built:**
- Complete Microsoft cloud SOC from scratch
- Microsoft Sentinel SIEM with custom analytics rules
- Defender XDR for endpoint detection and response
- Azure Entra ID for identity management
- Microsoft Intune for device management

**What I Did:**
- Conducted phishing investigations with email analysis
- Built KQL queries for threat hunting
- Performed incident response following MITRE ATT&CK
- Created detection rules and analytics
- Documented real SOC cases with timelines

**Skills Demonstrated:** KQL query writing • Incident response • Threat hunting • Log correlation • MITRE ATT&CK mapping • Cloud security

**Stack:** Microsoft Sentinel • Defender XDR • Entra ID • Intune • Azure Monitor • KQL
